# Numerical AG

This is the collaboration area for those interested in the development of numerical packages for Macaulay2. For a taste of what is currently possible, check out [these resources][http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/Events/Workshop2017Atlanta-files/Day1/Anton/index.html] from a prior M2 event.

The "examples" subdirectory is intended to collect some illustrative examples---please feel free to add your own!

## Team Members

* Anton Leykin
* Francesco Galuppi
* Tim Duff 
* _anyone else who is interested_

## Potential Projects

* It would be nice to collect examples from various fields (eg. kinematics, tensor decompositions, statistics...) This way we can both test the software and further demonstrate its usefulness.
* We should test dependencies among packages---for instance, are the PHC and Bertini interfaces thoroughly integrated into the other packages that may benefit from them?
* Various numerical routines, such as the multihomogeneous trace test [described here][https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00540.pdf] would be great additions to the NAG tree. There may be some design decisions to be made first...
* In general, packages may benefit from basic maintenance, added functionality, more robust checking of input/output, and improved interface. In particular, "NumericalHilbert" and "MonodromySolver" may be worth consdering for some of these tasks.
