data types
     parent and class; showStructure and showClassStructure
     ancestors
     basic data types: string, net, ZZ, RR, CC, Boolean, BasicList, HashTable, Function,
     	  Database, Dictionary, File, mutable and not
     === vs. ==
     sets (based on ===, hence sets of ideals have not been implemented)

new types of things
     give a brief example
     	  how about a type of list with no enclosing brackets for the nets?
	  net operations, netList

good coding style
     please read https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/wiki/Package-Writing-Style-Guide
     short code is good
         avoid redundant parentheses and redundant "return"
	 avoid duplication of code
	    e.g.:
	       flatten entries gens gb I
	       invent an abbreviation, such as
		  GroebnerBasis _* := G -> flatten gens G
     indentation
     avoid order N algorithms (e.g., lists growing by 1 each time)
     "for" versus "scan" and "apply" ?  (just for lists)

homework:

     1.  Write code to add a border of asterisks to a net.  For example,
	 from "abc" we get this:

	  *****
	  *abc*
	  *****

         Ensure that it adds 1 to the height and to the depth, while adding 2
         to the width, so it is positioned properly on an output line.

     2.  Implement the standard datatype known as "stacks" as a new type of
         basic list, where {} is the empty linked list, and the list {x,y}
         serves to hold the first element, x, and the remainder of the list, y.
         See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type) .
         Provide a suitable error message when popping is attempted from an
         empty stack.  (Warning: the M2 function "stack" is unrelated.)

     3.  Define a new type of basic list which implements filtered modules.
     	 The notation M^i should give the i-th entry in the filtration, with
     	 appropriate answers if i < 0 or i ≥ length M.  Implement "gr M" as the
     	 associated graded module.  Make "net" of it do something good looking.
