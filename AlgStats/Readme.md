Algebraic Statistics

This is the collaboration area for those interested in the development of algebraic statistics packages for Macaulay2.
Have a look at the two packages Graphical Models and Markov to see what has been implemented.


Potential Projects

Implement the conditional independences from the paper Algebraic Representations of Gaussian
Markov Combinations.

Implement the moment ideals and from the paper on moment varieties for other kinds of distributions.
